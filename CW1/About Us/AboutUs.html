            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>PlayStation is a brand that consists of home video game consoles, a media center, an online service, handhelds, and a line of controllers. The brand is produced by Sony Interactive Entertainment, a division of Sony, with the first console releasing in 1994. The brand consists of four home consoles, a media center, an online service, two handhelds and a phone, as well as multiple magazines, and a line of controllers, among other products.</p>
            <p>PlayStation was the brainchild of Ken Kutaragi, a Sony executive who had just finished managing one of the company's hardware engineering divisions at that time and would later be dubbed as "The Father of the PlayStation". The console's origins date back to 1988 where it was originally a joint project between Nintendo and Sony to create a CD-ROM for the Super Famicom. Although Nintendo denied the existence of the Sony deal as a result of a breakdown of the negotiations, Sony acquired the rights to the project after the contract was terminated.</p>
            <p>PlayStation was released in Japan on December 3, 1994, North America on September 9, 1995, Europe on September 29, 1995, and Oceania on November 15, 1995. The console was the first of the PlayStation lineup of home video game consoles. The PlayStation 2 was released in 2000, followed by the PlayStation 3 in 2006, and the PlayStation 4 in 2013. The PlayStation 5 was released in 2020.</p>
